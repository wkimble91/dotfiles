There's no place like `$HOME`
==================================================

This is my home, built on [Zsh], [Git], and [Stow], as well as other various config files.

[Git]: http://git-scm.com
[Zsh]: http://www.zsh.org
[Stow]: https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/

## Locations

- **Misc** config files live in `misc/*`. These files don't necessarily belong
  in your home directory (e.g. global config files) or on every system (e.g.
  OS-specific).

- **All Other** dotfiles live in `home/*`. These dot files are linked directly into
  your home directory.
